## 🚀 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Approach: Iterative Development with Auto-Deploy
Each phase will be:
1. Developed and tested locally
2. Committed to main branch
3. Auto-deployed via GitHub Actions → Firebase
4. Verified on live site
5. Reported to Commander Jiraiya

### Timeline Estimate
- **Phase II**: 2-3 hours (Core 3D infrastructure)
- **Phase III**: 3-4 hours (Interactive systems)
- **Phase IV**: 1-2 hours (Portal integration)
- **Total**: 6-9 hours of development time
