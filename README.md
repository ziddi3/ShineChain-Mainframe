## 🎮 Controls

### **Mobile:**
- **Drag anywhere** to swim through 3D space
- **Double-tap + hold** exhibit → swipe to launch
- **Pinch** to move forward/backward
- **Fast swipe** = high velocity launch
- **J-curve swipe** = hook shot behind you

### **Desktop:**
- **WASD/Arrow Keys** for movement
- **Mouse drag** to look around
- **Scroll wheel** for depth control
- **Space/Shift** for up/down

## 🏛️ Layers

1. **Zid's Sunshine Realm** - Nostalgic cobblestone streets where the Sunshine Kids once played
2. **Transformation Zone** - Bridge between past and future
3. **ShineChain Core** - Blockchain technology exhibits
4. **Infinite Possibilities** - Endless exploration space

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziddi3/ShineChain-Mainframe.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. No build process required - works instantly!

## 📱 Mobile Usage

Simply open any HTML file on your phone's browser. The experience is fully optimized for touch interaction with haptic feedback.

## 🎯 Object Launcher

Master these swipe patterns:
- **Straight swipe** = Direct forward launch
- **Fast swipe** = High velocity (watch the color indicators!)
- **J-curve swipe** = Hook shot behind viewpoint
- **Slow swipe** = Gentle push

### Velocity Indicators:
- 🟢 **Green** = Low velocity
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Medium velocity
- 🟠 **Orange** = High velocity
- 🔴 **Red** = Extreme velocity (with shake effect!)

**Note:** This is an experimental interface exploring 4D/5D navigation concepts. The "impossible architecture" is intentional - rooms are bigger inside than outside, and you can walk through dimensions that shouldn't physically connect.🔥 Testing Firebase auto-deploy with token!
