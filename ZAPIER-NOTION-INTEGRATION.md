# ðŸ”— Zapier + Notion Integration Guide for ShineChain

This guide walks you through connecting your ShineChain deployment system to Notion via Zapier for automatic deployment logging.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

A fully automated system where:
1. Every GitHub deployment triggers a webhook
2. Zapier catches the webhook data
3. Zapier creates a new entry in your Notion database
4. You get a complete deployment history in Notion

### Part 4: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. **Add Zapier Webhook URL:**
   ```bash
   # Go to: https://github.com/ziddi3/ShineChain-Mainframe/settings/secrets/actions
   # Click "New repository secret"
   
   Name: ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL
   Value: [paste your Zapier webhook URL from step 3.2]
   ```

2. **Add Notion API Key (Optional - for direct integration):**
   ```bash
   Name: NOTION_API_KEY
   Value: [paste your Notion integration token from step 1.3]
   ```

3. **Add Notion Database ID (Optional):**
   ```bash
   Name: NOTION_DEPLOYMENT_DB_ID
   Value: [paste your database ID from step 2.4]
   ```

---

### Part 5: Complete Zapier Configuration

1. **Trigger a Test Deployment:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Make a small change (e.g., edit README.md)
   - Commit and push to `main` branch
   - This will trigger the workflow and send data to Zapier

2. **Back in Zapier:**
   - Click "Test trigger" again
   - You should see the webhook data appear
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Configure Action:**
   - **App:** Notion
   - **Event:** Create Database Item
   - Click "Continue"
   - **Sign in to Notion** (if not already)
   - Click "Continue"

4. **Map Fields:**
   - **Database:** Select "ðŸŒž ShineChain Deployment Log"
   - **Project (Title):** Map to `project` from webhook
   - **Status:** Map to `status` from webhook
   - **Commit SHA:** Map to `commit` from webhook
   - **Workflow:** Map to `workflow` from webhook
   - **Deployed At:** Map to `timestamp` from webhook
   - **Deployment URL:** Map to `url` from webhook
   - **Notes:** (Optional) Add custom text or leave blank

5. **Test Action:**
   - Click "Test action"
   - Check your Notion database - you should see a new entry!
   - Click "Continue"

6. **Publish Zap:**
   - Give your Zap a name: "ShineChain Deployment Logger"
   - Click "Publish"

## âœ… Verification

### Test the Complete Flow

1. **Make a change to your repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ShineChain-Mainframe
   echo "Test deployment" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: verify Ever-Deploy v5 + Notion integration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Watch the deployment:**
   - Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ziddi3/ShineChain-Mainframe/actions)
   - Watch the workflow run
   - Check the "Log to Zapier/Notion" step

3. **Check Notion:**
   - Open your Notion database
   - You should see a new entry with:
     - Project: "ShineChain Mainframe"
     - Status: "Success" (green)
     - Commit SHA: Your latest commit
     - Workflow: "Ever-Deploy v5"
     - Deployed At: Current timestamp
     - Deployment URL: Your GitHub Pages URL

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Notion Dashboard Customization

### Create Views

1. **Success Rate View:**
   - Add a "Board" view
   - Group by: Status
   - See success/failure distribution

2. **Timeline View:**
   - Add a "Timeline" view
   - Show by: Deployed At
   - Visualize deployment frequency

3. **Recent Deployments:**
   - Add a "Table" view
   - Sort by: Deployed At (descending)
   - Show only last 20 entries

### Add Formulas

1. **Days Since Last Deploy:**
   ```
   dateBetween(now(), prop("Deployed At"), "days")
   ```

2. **Success Rate:**
   - Create a formula property
   - Count successes vs total deployments

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Zapier Not Receiving Data

**Problem:** Webhook test times out or shows no data

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly in GitHub Secrets
2. Check the webhook URL doesn't have extra spaces
3. Trigger a manual deployment: `gh workflow run "Ever-Deploy ShineChain Mainframe"`
4. Check GitHub Actions logs for webhook errors

### Notion Not Updating

**Problem:** Zapier receives data but Notion doesn't update

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Notion integration has access to the database
2. Check field mappings in Zapier are correct
3. Ensure database properties match expected types
4. Check Zapier task history for error messages

### Wrong Data in Notion

**Problem:** Fields are empty or incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Review field mappings in Zapier
2. Check webhook payload in Zapier test data
3. Verify property names match exactly
4. Test with a fresh deployment
